00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
After reading tons of productivity books, I came across so many rules, like the two-year rule,

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,400
the five-minute rule, the five-second rule. No, not that five-second rule. The problem is that these

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,840
rules are meant for companies or entrepreneurs. But I was able to adapt them to my studies during

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,640
med school and drastically cut down on my procrastination. So I'm going to share with you two different

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,600
two-minute rules for the next two minutes. The first two-minute rule comes from getting things done

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,800
by David Allen. He says, if it takes two minutes to do, get it done right now. For example, if I

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,440
need to take out the trash today, it takes two minutes to do it. So if I'm thinking about it now,

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,400
I might as well just do it now. Instead of writing it down on a to-do list or probably forgetting

9
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,280
about it or having to come back to it later, which takes more than two minutes. That's how I see it.

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,000
So here's a list of things that might take two minutes throughout the day, like organizing a desk,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,200
or watering your plants, or clipping those nasty nails. I just do it when I notice it, but these

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:00,480
little things start to add up. So this rule biases my brain towards taking action and away from

13
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
procrastination. The second two-minute rule comes from Atomic Habits by James Clear. He says,

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,720
when you're trying to do something you don't really want to do, simplify the task down to two

15
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,200
minutes or less. So doing your entire reading assignment becomes just reading one paragraph,

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,520
or memorizing the entire periodic table becomes memorizing just 10 flashcards. Now, some of you might

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:25,120
think, yeah, this is just a Jedi mind trick. Like, why would I fall for it? How is this at all

18
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,040
sustainable? And to that, he says, when you're starting out, limit yourself to only two minutes.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,400
So back in med school, I wanted to build a habit of studying for one hour every day before dinner.

20
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,880
So I tried this trick, but I lived in myself to just two minutes. I'd sit down, open my laptop,

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,200
study for two minutes, and then close my laptop and went to do something else. It seems

22
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,480
unproductive at first, right? It seems stupid. But staying consistent with this two-minute routine

23
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,560
day after day meant that I was becoming the type of person who studies daily. I was mastering the

24
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,040
habit of just showing up because a habit needs to be established before it can be expanded upon.

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,240
If I can't become a person who studies for just two minutes a day, I'd never be able to

26
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,800
become the person that studies for an hour a day. You've got to start somewhere, but starting small

27
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:20,080
is easier. There's a lot of other useful tips from books. I cover more here in this video on

28
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
three books in three minutes. Check it out. And if you guys like these types of videos, let me know
